The necessary executable is built by running 'make'

-------------
Known Issues
-------------

- Nodes that are within range of each other only send their OWN data packet to the neighbouring node instead of potentially their entire buffer. However, a node still trasnmits its entire buffer to the base station when in range.

-----------
How to run
-----------

-The program is run by executing the sensorNetwork executable:

Usage: ./sensorNetwork <K> <D> <R> <P> <N>
    K - number of simulated time steps
    D - distance moved during each time step
    R - transmission range
    P - max number of data packet transmissions
    N - 0-10 chooses a node to print debug info, -1 to ignore


---------------
Things to note
---------------

-When N is provided between 0-10, I chose to print more debug info than was requested in the assignment spec, mostly for my own debugging suring implementation. The infor I print is:
  -> The current turn number
  -> Whenever in range of another node, print which node you are within range of
  -> The contents of any packets sent
  -> the contents of any packets received
  -> An indication of cases where no data is sent (due to having no packets buffered, cannot afford to send, or have already send to the peer node within range)
