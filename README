The necessary executable is built by running 'make'

-------------
Known Issues
-------------

The program does not exit by itself and instead requires that the user press CTRL + c once the results are printed. This is because I was running into issues where certain processes would finish early, thus killing their connection with the others. To solve this, each process does an infinite while loop, while(1), once all necessary computations are complete.

-----------
How to run
-----------

-The program is run by executing the sensorNetwork executable:

Usage: ./sensorNetwork <K> <D> <R> <P> <N>
    K - number of simulated time steps
    D - distance moved during each time step
    R - transmission range
    P - max number of data packet transmissions
    N - 0-10 chooses a node to print debug info, -1 to ignore


---------------
Things to note
---------------

-When N is provided between 0-10, I chose to print more debug info than was requested in the assignment spec, mostly for my own debugging suring implementation. The infor I print is:
  -> The current turn number
  -> Whenever in range of another node, print which node ou are within range of
  -> Whether or not you have already sent the other node your data.
